# toolshed.npoco

Simple base classes and helpers for using Npoco in a project.

##Depedendencies
SqlServerDatabase from https://github.com/schotime/NPoco
Redis Caching - this is not a requirement since there is a base class that does not use caching, however,
your project will have a depedency on Microsoft's caching extensions since this is part of the library
